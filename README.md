# Clique Detection of ASE and GEE
Graph embedding techniques have exhibited robust performance across a variety of tasks, such as vertex classification and graph matching, yet their efficacy in clique de- tection remains notably limited. There is a lack of theoretical understanding regarding the efficacy of spectral embedding techniques in detecting clique within graphs. In this paper, we prove the limitation of Adjacency Spectral Embedding (ASE) and Graph Encoder Embedding (GEE) in identifying the differences between the clique-inserted graph embedding from the original graph embedding, particularly when confronted with small-sized cliques of the order $\log(n)$. To enrich the analysis, we introduce the Variational Graph Auto-Encoder (VGAE) model in our experiments. Our findings demonstrate the proficiency of all three methods in detecting larger-sized cliques.
